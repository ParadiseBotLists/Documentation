# Update Time
Hey everyone, Toxic here. As we look forward to kicking off the new year right here at paradise I wanted to make a quick post to keep the community up to date on what to expect from the Paradise Bots team as of 2021.
First of we would like to thank all of you who supported us throughout the remainder of 2020.

Here at Paradise especially the Development Side of it we like to try to give you all the best Paradise possible. 
With that being said I am pleased to announce that 2021 will bring a list of major changes to Paradise Bots as we work on and plan to roll out Paradise v3

## What's to come? 
Okay so cut to the chase right? You want to know exactly what to expect let me dumb it down:

* Completely redesigned and more stable website

* Updated and better operating themes and manager

* Bot Analytics

* Live Preview Edits

And the list goes on.

### Back to reality
Now back to the community, when I started paradise I honestly didn’t expect it to grow to become what it has in the short time it has taken to get there.
As a token of my appreciation I will be redoing a recent giveaway that didn’t go so well so make sure you keep your eyes open 😉

Much love ❤️ and happy 2021
