Hello again everyone, I'll keep it short I promise, as we kick off the new year myself and the rest of the development team have had some discussions about what we can update
and change to keep providing you all with the best version of paradise possible, we have come to the conclusion that the only viable option here
Is to once again perform a rewrite on Paradise Bots as a whole and bring you all a new easier to use and up to date version of our website.

I am beyond proud of paradise and where it has come and I say that time and time again, but the truth is I know and we all know that it's still
not the best that it can be. That is why we have agreed to beginning to work on Version 3 of the site which includes this new and improved docs/support/blog site, 
and will bring you all a TON of new features of bug fixes.

## The Current Site
The current version of paradisebots.net and it's API will remain live untill we are ready for a production release and will post updates of the development
process as often as possible, we aren't going anywhere anytime soon as much as you probably thought that's what this post is about. It's not.. 


## Outro
I want to once again thank you all for your continued love and support through the long journey here, we really couldn't have done it with out
the help and support of our community as a whole.

Much Love ❤️
- Toxic Dev
