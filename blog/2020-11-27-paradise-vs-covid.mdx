# COVID Update
Hello all, Toxic here just wanted to stop by and give an update in regards the CoronaVirus and how it may or may not impact the PBL Team.
First and foremost we all know by now that COVID has put a huge impact on a lot of the country’s we all know and love, with that being said I would like to extend some condolences on behalf of the entire PBL team to those of you who may have been or know someone who may have been affected by it.
As the colder weather starts to come around again for most of us it has now come back to the time where we face a risk of more and more cases, and more and more restrictions.

## What does this mean for PBL?
As of right now, nothing we are an Online Based Community and as such our work and what we do relies solely on the status of Internet Services Providers, Our Host(s) & of course Discord.
With that being said this DOES NOT mean that we don’t face a risk of these services becoming unavailable or unreliable, OR Some of our staff becoming busy, unavailable or simply just needing personal time, In the event that this happens please bare with us as this virus does affect all of us.

Myself and the rest of our Staff Team will continue to monitor the status of the services we require and COVID itself and update you all as necessary.

### Things that definitely won’t happen!!
* Temporarily shutting down Paradise Bots
* Firing members of our staff team or banning bot devs for needing personal time due to COVID
* Slower queue and or support times (There will and should always be someone available)
